# Darwin Simulation

## Project Description

The "Darwin Simulation" project is an application that enables real-time ecosystem simulation. The program allows users to run simulations with selected parameters, analyze statistics, and visualize interactions between organisms on a map.

## Technologies Used

* **Java 21**
* **JavaFX**
* **Gradle**
* **IntelliJ IDEA**

## Main Features

* Ability to choose from predefined configurations or create custom simulation settings
* Support for running multiple simulations simultaneously in separate windows
* Animation showing the positions of animals and plants on the map
* Visualization of animal energy levels (e.g., using colors or health bars)
* Ability to pause and resume the simulation at any moment
* Tracking statistics such as:

  * Number of animals and plants
  * Number of free fields
  * Most popular genotypes
  * Average animal energy level
  * Average lifespan of dead animals
  * Average number of offspring of living animals
* Ability to track a selected animal â€“ including its genome, energy level, number of eaten plants, offspring, and descendants
* Highlighting fields preferred by plants and animals with dominant genotypes
* Exporting statistics to a CSV file for analysis in programs like Excel
